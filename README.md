***Dungeon Explorer is an immersive and collaborative Dungeons and Dragons-inspired maze exploration game designed for multiplayer engagement. The project is a multiplayer text-based game server that allows multiple players to connect and interact with each other in a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) themed maze environment. Players navigate through the maze, encounter challenges, and communicate with each other as they progress through the game.***




# Clone the repository to your local machine:
```git clone <repository-url>```

# Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository:
```cd <repository-directory```

### Create a .env file  and  place this command ```API_KEY = apikey``` replace ```apikey``` with the actual Gemini Api Key.

# Running the Server:
Open a terminal window or tab.
Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
## Run the server using the following command:
```python server.py``` in your terminal or command prompt.


# Connecting Players:
Open multiple terminal windows or tabs for each player.
Navigate to the directory containing the game files in each terminal.
Run the client script to connect each player to the server:
```python client.py```


**Use ```/generate_maze``` command to generate a D&D maze or any other relevant commands to progress in the game.**



**Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the repository where you cloned the game files, and <repository-directory> with the name of the directory created after cloning the repository. Also, ensure to replace "apikey" with your actual Gemini API key in the .env file before running the server and connecting players.**
